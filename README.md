# Instructions

You must run the backend and front end.

Backend runs on `localhost:8000`
frontend runs on `localhost:3000`

1. In backend, make sure to copy `.env.example` to `.env` and provide the credentials. Follow the [README](backend/README.md) in backend for more details
2. In frontend, make sure to run `npm install` then `npm run start`.
    - Most of the work has been done in the `frontend/src/App.js`
